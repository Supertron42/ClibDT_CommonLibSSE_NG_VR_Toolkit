ClibDT Source License v1.0

Friendly Notice:
----------------
This project was created to support the development of SKSE mods, and I sincerely welcome any contributions — 
as long as they build upon the project rather than supersede it.

This license defines reasonable boundaries, but it is not meant to be enforced harshly.  
If you're acting in good faith, I’ll be understanding.

I will not report or escalate any violations of these terms without first attempting to contact you.  
If I find something questionable, I’ll usually just be curious — not confrontational.

This toolkit includes or helps install third-party tools and libraries.  
You must respect the original licenses of those components.  
Each bundled or downloaded tool retains its own license and ownership — this license does not override them.
