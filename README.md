## Menu Options Explained

### **1. Set Environment Variables (required)**
Guides you through setting up the key folders and paths used by the toolkit:
- Where your dev projects live
- Where your Skyrim game and mods are
- (Optional) Path to GitHub Desktop

**You must do this first!**

---

### **2. Install VS (or Build Tools), Git, Xmake, GitHub Desktop, Ninja**
Downloads and installs all the developer tools you need:
- Visual Studio 2022 Community or Build Tools (for compiling)
- Git for Windows (version control)
- Xmake (build system)
- GitHub Desktop (optional, for GUI git)

You can skip any tool you already have previously installed.

---

### **3. Create a New Project**
Creates a ready-to-build SKSE plugin project:
- Prompts for project name, author, version
- Sets up folders and a starter `xmake.lua`
- Supports SE, AE, and VR builds

---

### **4. Update Project Dependencies**
Keeps your project up to date:
- Updates Xmake package index
- Optionally upgrades all required packages

Use this after editing `xmake.lua` or to upgrade libraries.

---

### **5. Build Project (Debug or Release)**
Compiles your plugin using Xmake:
- Choose Debug or Release mode
- Detects runtime settings (SE, AE, VR)
- Shows build progress and output

---

### **6. Regenerate xmake.lua**
Regenerates your project’s `xmake.lua`:
- Updates name, version, author, description
- Ensures correct runtime logic and macros

Use if you want to reset or update your build script.

---

### **7. Git Stage & Commit Project**
Helps you manage version control:
- Initializes a Git repository (if needed)
- Stages all changes
- Prompts for a commit message
- Optionally launches GitHub Desktop

---

### **8. Detach Git (Remove History)**
Removes the `.git` folder from your project:
- Permanently deletes all Git commit history and tracking
- Useful if you cloned a template and want to start fresh

---

### **9. Smart Backup Dev Folder**
Creates a safe backup of your entire dev root:
- Backs up all projects and settings
- Useful before major changes or upgrades

---

### **10. Refresh Existing Project**
Refreshes your project folder:
- Cleans up temporary files and folders
- Ensures your project structure is up to date
- Useful if you’ve made manual changes or want to reset the workspace

---

### **11. Clear Environment Variables**
Removes all ClibDT-related environment variables for this session:
- Lets you reset or reconfigure your environment safely
- Only affects the current session (does not change system-wide settings)
- Prompts for confirmation and lists all variables to be removed

---
